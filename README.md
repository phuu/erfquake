# You like earthquakes? You like lights?

Try this light show, triggered by an earthquake.

Yep, triggered by an **earthquake**.

## Wat.

Clone it.

```

```

Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, and [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) on as many devices as you like.

Wait long enough (for an earthquake) and the light show will start â€“ open up the console in your browser to watch it wait for an earthquake. It's normally only about 5 minutes.

If you can't be bothered to wait, just click **go**.

It's still in development, and if you're having trouble getting it to work submit an issue or contact [me](/phuu)!
